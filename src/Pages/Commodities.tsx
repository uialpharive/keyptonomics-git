                Energy commodities comprise hard commodities (both renewable as
                well as non-renewable resources/ commodities) which are usually
                mined or are extracted from mother earth.

                As for the current times, the most developed commodity market is
                in the non-renewable energy commodities. Resources such as coal,
                oil, and natural gas fall into this category. The trading growth
                in this category reflects the economic growth of any nation,
                organization, individual traders and so on. For instance, oil is
                a highly favored energy commodity that is widely sought after.

                Energy commodities are a very beneficial trading element and
                bring about a lot of profit if traded well. But given these
                commodities are nature and environment-based, things like
                weather and global warming affect their trading. Other factors
                such as politics and other economic events also affect its
                trading.
